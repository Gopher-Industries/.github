# Welcome to Gopher Industries, the MedTech and HealthTech Incubator at Deakin University! ðŸ‘‹

We are excited to have you on board and look forward to working together to create innovative solutions in the field of medical and health technology. This guide will provide you with all the necessary information to get you started and thrive in our community.

## Our Structure

At Gopher Industries, we believe in a flat structure that encourages group leadership and contributions. We do not have traditional roles like CEOs or CTOs. Instead, we focus on the contributions made by students (you guys!) to our products.

## Our Operations - "The Three C's"

1. **Code:** We use GitHub as our code repository. All our product repositories are housed in a company-wide GitHub Organization. We have Git Leads who help manage this and coordinate activities and agreed policies. If you have good knowledge of GitHub, you can contribute significantly in this area.

   - GitHub Organization: [Gopher Industries on GitHub](https://github.com/gopherindustries)

   - Git Leads: EREENA BAGGA and JYHE MARK

2. **Communication:** We use MS Teams for direct communication with students and for updates about events. We have Comms Leads who manage this communication. They also handle the Company-wide OnTrack submissions.

   - Comms Leads: VANESSA JOSEPHINE MATTEA

3. **Coordination:** We use Trello as our main source of truth for all the activities happening in Gopher Industries. It provides clear visibility of our work and is tailored to our needs using a SCRUM framework. Product Backlog Leads are responsible for managing the product backlog on each of the Trello boards.

## Our Contributors
